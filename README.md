### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you are working with a version control system like Git, clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Python-Code-Reviewer.git```
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install all required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt```
   Ensure that you have **Streamlit** and **google-generativeai** in the requirements.txt file.
3. **Set Up API Key**:
The app uses Google’s Generative AI API. Make sure you have a valid API key from Google’s platform. Set it up in the script as shown below:
   
  ```python
  ai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
```
  Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual API key.
  
4.  **Run the Application**:
  Finally, run the Streamlit app using the following command:

  ```bash
  streamlit run app.py
```
  This will open the app in your browser where you can start testing it.
